## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs. The process includes data collection, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and testing.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images of cats and dogs. The images were obtained from a publicly available dataset (e.g., Kaggle's Cats and Dogs Dataset). The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
